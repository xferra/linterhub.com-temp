## Background

In our projects, we often use many JSON Objects for work. For each object needs to make tests and changes. After the discussion ended up, proposed to use JSON Objects in a separate repository for convenience and working with.

But many projects can use one JSON object and when JSON is updated, need for that projects working is fine. The decision of this trouble is [semantic releases](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).

Finally, we have a lot of JSON Objects, schemes and tests for them and semantic release. Then after we create this repository based on the [teamplate](../../../template/) of the organization linterhub.
